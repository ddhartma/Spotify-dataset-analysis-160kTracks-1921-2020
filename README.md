# Spotify dataset analysis: 160k tracks between 1921-2020

In this study based on a Spotify Dataset from Kaggle with 160k tracks released between 1921 and 2020 a set of input features and their dependence on song popularity has been studied.  
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) can be found on the Kaggle webpage.

During the dataset analysis of a set of questions came up:  

1. In order to write a popular song, is the key and mode of the song important?
2. What are those songs with high popularity but zero tempo, zero danceability and zero speechiness?
3. 1955-1960: The popularity level climbs up - Who are the most famous artists at this time?
4. Which actual top artists write/have the most popular songs?
5. How do you become a famous song writer?

## DataFrame Summary:
- Dataset with 170653 observations, 19 columns (13 numerical and 6 categorical/dummy) and no nan values
- **numerical** columns:
    - acousticness: The relative metric of the track being acoustic, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - danceability: The relative measurement of the track being danceable, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - energy: The energy of the track,  (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - duration_ms: The length of the track in milliseconds (ms), (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
    - instrumentalness:, The relative ratio of the track being instrumental, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - valence: The positiveness of the track, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - popularity: The popularity of the song lately, default country = US, (Ranges from 0 to 100)
    - tempo:The tempo of the track in Beat Per Minute (BPM), (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150)
    - liveness: The relative duration of the track sounding as a live performance, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - loudness: Relative loudness of the track in decibel (dB), (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)
    - speechiness: The relative length of the track containing any kind of human voice, (Ranges from 0 to 1)
    - year: The release year of track, (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)
    - id, The primary identifier for the track, generated by Spotify

- **categorical** columns:
    - key: The primary key of the track encoded as integers in between 0 and 11 (starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦)
    - artists: The list of artists credited for production of the track
    - release_date: Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary
    - name: The title of the track
    - mode: The binary value representing whether the track starts with a major (1) chord progression or a minor (0)
    - explicit: The binary value whether the track contains explicit content or not, (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)


This project was part of the Udacity Nanodegree program [Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/).

This analysis is based on a jupyter notebook and Python files.

## Setup Instructions

The notebook **Spotifiy_160k_1921_2020_analysis.ipynb** contains the investigation process of the dataset and and the results.
The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a managed notebook instance, from which the notebooks can be completed and run.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites: Installation of Python via Anaconda and Command Line Interaface
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Install Python 3.7 - 64 Bit
- If you need a good Command Line Interface (CLI) under Windowsa you could use [git](https://git-scm.com/). Under Mac OS use the pre-installed Terminal.

- Upgrade Anaconda via
```
$ conda upgrade conda
$ conda upgrade --all
```

- Optional: In case of trouble add Anaconda to your system path. Write in your CLI
```
$ export PATH="/path/to/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
```

### Clone the project
- Open your Command Line Interface
- Change Directory to your project older, e.g. `cd my_github_projects`
- Clone the Github Project inside this folder with Git Bash (Terminal) via:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ddhartma/Around-The-World-Image-Classifier.git
```

- Change Directory
```
$ cd 
```

- Create a new Python environment via the provided yml file. Inside Git Bash (Terminal) write:
```
$ conda env create -f env_windows.yml (under Windows)
$ conda env create -f env_macOS.yml (under Mac OS)
```

- Check the environment installation via
```
$ conda env list
```

- Activate the installed MTP_LSTM environment via
```
$ conda activate atw_macOS (Mac OS)
$ conda activate atw_windows
```
### Open and run the notebook

Now that the repository has been cloned into the notebook instance you may navigate to the notebook. Run the notebook via

```
jupyter notebook SageMaker Project.ipynb
```
